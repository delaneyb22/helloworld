# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a basic python Hello world file. 

My purpose for creating this is to create a virtual workspace with Github, VSCode, and the languages and software I will be learning. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
